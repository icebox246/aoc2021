# Advent of Code 2021

This year I'm planning to use mainly [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) as my programming language of choice.
This may change since I'm not that great in Haskell and my secondary option is probably going to be C.

Languages:

- Day 02: Haskell
- Day 03: Haskell
- Day 04: Haskell
- Day 05: Haskell
